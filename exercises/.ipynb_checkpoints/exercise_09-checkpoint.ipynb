    "**2. Create a program that reads a tab separated file with numbers, matrix.dat, (to be understood as a matrix) and stores the numbers in a matrix (list of lists). Having read the matrix from file it should now transpose it (rows to columns and columns to rows) and in the end print the transposed matrix to the screen. The output should look like the input, not a python data structure. You must construct a function like transpose(matrix), which transpose the matix without using any global variables. This can be done in two ways.**\n",
