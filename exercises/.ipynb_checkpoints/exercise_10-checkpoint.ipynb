This way ensures that your program is easy to change to other forms of matrix calculations. Here are two links to the definition of matrix multiplication.*"

If you look at the second line there is a lot of 0 and 1. A '0' means that values in that column are from a cancer patient and a '1' means data are from a control (healty person). The data are all log(intensity), i.e. the logarithm of the mesured intensity of the relevant spot on the dna-chip. The data in this file will be used in comming exercises. Oh, yes - the data/columns are tab separated. The second item on each line is the accession number for that particular gene.\n",

Then it shall search in the file for the data concerning that accession number. If it does not find it (you gave a wrong accession no), complain and stop. Otherwise it shall display the data in two tab separated columns. First column shall be the data from the cancer patients, second column for the controls. And yes, there are not the same number of sick and healthy people - be able to handle that.**\n"
